# Epigrascan - Module 01 📜🔍

## Overview

**Epigrascan** is an AI-Driven Decision Support System designed for the Character Extraction, Probabilistic Restoration, and Segmentation of Early Brahmi Estampages.

Deciphering ancient Early Brahmi stone inscriptions from paper rubbings (estampages) is highly subjective and prone to human cognitive bias. Traditional monolithic AI models fail on these artifacts due to severe physical weathering, partial character erosion, and continuous spaceless writing (*scriptio continua*). 

Epigrascan solves this via a **decoupled, three-stage decision support system**. This repository module encompasses the first two critical stages: specialized computer vision to extract characters from extreme stone noise, and a deep learning classifier to identify them.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### 1. Stage 1: Segmentation (Image Cleaning & Cropping)
Stone rubbings are heavily unstructured and noisy. This stage isolates the text from the stone texture using advanced morphological and mathematical techniques.
* **Key Techniques:** Non-Local Means (NLM) denoising, Bilateral filtering, polynomial baseline tracking, and Connected Component Analysis (CCA).
* **Goal:** Intelligently separate the rock background from the ink and cleanly crop out individual characters.

### 2. Stage 2: Classification (Deep Learning Inference)
Once characters are cleanly isolated, they are passed to a lightweight convolutional neural network.
* **Model:** MobileNetV2, classifying 368 distinct Brahmi classes (consonants, vowels, and compounds).
* **Curriculum Learning:** The model training dynamically injects heavy synthetic noise (simulating stone cracks, erosion, and elastic warping from bad rubbings) at later epochs to ensure robust, real-world performance.
* **Output:** JSON files containing probabilistic transliteration sequences, confidence scores, and raw softmax outputs.

## 🚀 Usage

All configurations (dataset paths, model hyperparameters, training settings) are managed centrally in `config.yaml`. 

### 1. Segmentation
Run the segmentation pipeline to clean and extract character crops from raw estampages.
```bash
python src/s1_segmentation/segmenter_core.py
```

### 2. Training the Classifier
Train the MobileNetV2 model using the curriculum learning schedule defined in `config.yaml`.
```bash
python src/s2_classification/train_classifier.py
```

### 3. Inference
Run the inference pipeline to classify previously segmented characters.
```bash
python src/s2_classification/inference.py
```

### 4. Restoration
Validate outputs and reconstruct the document space.
```bash
python src/s3_restoration/check_json.py
```

## ⚠️ Notes on Legacy Code
All deprecated code (monolithic v1, older backups) has been moved to the `archive_deprecated/` directory. If you are a new contributor, **do not** use or import files from this directory unless retrieving old experimental logic. All active development should take place inside `src/`.
